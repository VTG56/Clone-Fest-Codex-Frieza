Chyrp Lite Next.js/Firebase Revamp
1.0 Executive Summary
Project Goal: To re-engineer the legacy Chyrp Lite PHP application into a modern, high-performance, and scalable web platform using Next.js for the frontend and the Firebase suite (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Functions) for the backend.

Core Objective: Achieve feature parity with the original Chyrp Lite while leveraging the benefits of a serverless architecture, including improved developer experience, scalability, and performance. This document breaks down every identifiable feature into actionable requirements.

2.0 Core Architectural & Platform Requirements
This section covers the foundational elements inferred from directories like /includes, /themes, and root-level files like install.php.

2.1 Frontend Framework:

Requirement: The entire UI/UX must be built with Next.js.

Rationale: Enables Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for excellent SEO and performance, a component-based architecture for maintainability, and a robust routing system.

2.2 Backend Services (Firebase):

Authentication: User login, registration, and session management must be handled by Firebase Authentication. This will support email/password and potentially social logins.

Database: Cloud Firestore will serve as the primary database, replacing MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL. The data modeling must be NoSQL-native (collections and documents).

File Storage: All user uploads (images, videos, audio, etc.) must be handled by Firebase Storage.

Serverless Functions: Backend logic, such as post-processing uploads or handling webmentions, will be implemented using Cloud Functions for Firebase.

2.3 Installation & Configuration:

Requirement: Replace the install.php process with a guided, web-based setup flow.

User Story: As an administrator, upon first launch, I want to be guided through a setup process to configure my site title, create the initial admin account, and connect to my Firebase project credentials.

Implementation: A protected route /setup that runs only if the application is not yet configured. It will write the initial configuration to a secure location (e.g., environment variables or a specific document in Firestore).

2.4 Theming System (Inferred from /themes):

Requirement: The system must support customizable themes.

User Story: As an administrator, I want to be able to switch between different visual themes for my blog from the admin panel.

Implementation: Themes will be structured as sets of Next.js components. The selected theme's components will be dynamically rendered. A theme might consist of a theme.json for settings (colors, fonts) and custom React components for Header, Footer, PostLayout, etc. The five original themes should be recreated.

2.5 User & Permissions Model (Inferred from admin/users.php):

Requirement: Implement a comprehensive roles and permissions system.

Roles:

Visitor: Can view public posts, like, and comment (if enabled).

User: A registered user with basic privileges.

Editor: Can create, edit, and delete their own posts.

Administrator: Full control over the site, including managing users, settings, and all content.

Implementation: Use Firebase Auth Custom Claims to assign roles to users. Frontend and backend logic (Firestore Security Rules) will enforce permissions based on these roles.

2.6 Extensibility & Modules (Inferred from /modules):

Requirement: The architecture must allow for modular features that can be enabled or disabled by the admin, just like the original.

Implementation: A configuration document in Firestore (settings/modules) will hold the enabled/disabled state of each module. The application will conditionally render components and activate backend logic based on this configuration.

3.0 Content Types ("Feathers") - Detailed Requirements
This section breaks down each content type found in the /feathers directory.

3.1 Text (Feather: text.php)

Description: A standard blog post with a title and body.

Fields: title (string), content (Markdown/HTML), slug (string, auto-generated).

Data Model (posts collection): { type: 'text', title: '...', content: '...', authorId: '...', ... }

Editor: Must support a rich text editor (e.g., TipTap) or a simple Markdown editor with live preview.

3.2 Photo (Feather: photo.php)

Description: An image post with an optional caption.

Fields: image (file upload), caption (string), altText (string).

Functional Requirements:

Image upload interface (drag-and-drop).

File uploads to Firebase Storage.

A Cloud Function should trigger on upload to create multiple sizes (e.g., thumbnail, medium, large).

The post will store URLs to these images.

Data Model: { type: 'photo', caption: '...', altText: '...', image: { originalUrl: '...', mediumUrl: '...', thumbUrl: '...' }, ... }

3.3 Quote (Feather: quote.php)

Description: A post formatted to highlight a quotation.

Fields: quote (text), source (string, can be a name or a URL).

Data Model: { type: 'quote', quote: '...', source: '...', ... }

3.4 Link (Feather: link.php)

Description: A post that primarily serves to share a URL.

Fields: url (URL), title (string), description (text).

Functional Requirement: The post title should link directly to the external URL.

Data Model: { type: 'link', url: '...', title: '...', description: '...', ... }

3.5 Video (Feather: video.php)

Description: A post for uploading and displaying a video.

Fields: video (file upload), caption (string).

Functional Requirements:

Upload video files to Firebase Storage.

Consider using a service like Mux or Cloudflare Stream via a Cloud Function for transcoding to web-friendly formats (HLS/DASH) for adaptive streaming. Storing raw video files for web playback is inefficient.

Data Model: { type: 'video', caption: '...', videoUrl: '...', ... }

3.6 Audio (Feather: audio.php)

Description: A post for uploading and playing an audio file.

Fields: audio (file upload), title (string), artist (string).

Functional Requirements:

Upload audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) to Firebase Storage.

Render an HTML5 <audio> player.

Data Model: { type: 'audio', title: '...', artist: '...', audioUrl: '...', ... }

3.7 Uploader (Feather: uploader.php)

Description: A special post type for uploading multiple files, presented as a gallery or list.

Fields: files (multiple file uploads), description (text).

Data Model: { type: 'uploader', description: '...', files: [{ name: '...', url: '...', type: '...' }, { ... }], ... }

4.0 Modules (Extensions) - Detailed Requirements
This breaks down each feature from the /modules directory.

4.1 Cacher (cacher.php)

Original Goal: Reduce server load.

Next.js Equivalent: Leverage Next.js's native caching capabilities.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Use getStaticProps for blog index pages and individual posts.

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Set a revalidate timer to rebuild pages periodically without a full redeployment.

Firebase CDN: Firebase Hosting automatically caches content on its global CDN.

4.2 Categorize (categorize.php)

Requirement: Assign a single category to a post.

Data Model: Create a categories collection. Posts will have a categoryId field referencing a document in this collection.

Admin UI: An interface to create, edit, and delete categories. A dropdown in the post editor to select a category.

Frontend: Pages to display all posts within a specific category (e.g., /category/[slug]).

4.3 Tags (tags.php)

Requirement: Assign multiple, freeform tags to a post.

Data Model: Posts will have a tags array field (e.g., tags: ['nextjs', 'firebase', 'dev']). Create a separate tags collection to track tag usage counts.

Admin UI: An input field with auto-completion for existing tags.

Frontend: Pages to display all posts with a specific tag (e.g., /tags/[tagname]).

4.4 Comments (comments.php)

Requirement: A full-featured commenting system.

Data Model: Use a subcollection: posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}.

Fields: authorName, authorEmail, content, timestamp, status (pending, approved, spam).

Functional Requirements:

Comment submission form (with validation).

Firestore Security Rules to allow logged-in users (or anonymous users, if configured) to create comments with a pending status.

Admin UI for moderating comments (Approve, Spam, Delete).

Display approved comments under each post.

4.5 Likes (likes.php)

Requirement: Allow visitors to "like" a post.

Data Model: A likes subcollection on each post (posts/{postId}/likes/{userId}) or a simple counter field (likeCount) on the post document, updated via a Cloud Function for scalability.

Functional Requirements: A like button that, when clicked, increments the count. Prevent multiple likes from the same user (track by userId for logged-in users, or local storage/fingerprinting for anonymous users).

4.6 MAPTCHA (maptcha.php)

Original Goal: Spam prevention using math problems.

Modern Equivalent:

Recommended: Integrate a service like hCaptcha or Google reCAPTCHA (v3). This is far more robust.

To replicate the original: Generate a simple math problem in a Cloud Function, store the answer in the user's session, and validate it upon form submission.

4.7 Cascade (cascade.php)

Original Goal: AJAX-powered infinite scrolling.

Next.js Equivalent: Use a library like react-infinite-scroll-component or the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user scrolls to the bottom of the post list. On detection, fetch the next paginated set of posts from Firestore.

4.8 Other Modules:

Read More (read_more.php): In the Next.js component that renders post previews, simply truncate the content field after a certain character/word count.

Rights (rights.php): Add a license or copyright field to the post data model.

Lightbox (lightbox.php): Integrate a modern React lightbox library (e.g., yet-another-react-lightbox).

Sitemap (sitemap.php): Use Next.js's built-in support for generating sitemap.xml on-the-fly or at build time.

Highlighter (highlighter.php): Use a library like highlight.js or prism-react-renderer to apply syntax highlighting to code blocks in the frontend.

Post Views (post_views.php): Create a Cloud Function that increments a viewCount field on a post document. Call this function from the client-side when a post is viewed.

MathJax (mathjax.php): Integrate a React-compatible LaTeX rendering library like react-katex.

Easy Embed (easy_embed.php): Use a library like react-oembed-container to automatically convert links (from YouTube, Twitter, etc.) into embedded content
