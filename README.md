## What can Chyrp Lite do for me?
With Chyrp Lite you can run your own blog on your own web server with minimal fuss.
Chyrp Lite provides three beautiful blog themes and a friendly administration environment,
all fully navigable on desktop computers and mobile devices, thanks to the power of
responsive HTML5. Semantic markup and comprehensive ARIA labelling ensure your blog will
be accessible to visitors who use assistive technologies.

With Chyrp Lite's system of Feathers and Pages you can make your blog whatever you want
it to be: you can have a traditional blog, a tumbleblog, or add oodles of customisation
and build a web publishing platform with blogging features on the side.

Feathers support different types of content in your blog posts: you can restrict yourself
to absolute textual purity, or you can turn on everything and blog a multimedia rainbow.
Pages allow you to publish articles on your site that are independent of your blog content.
